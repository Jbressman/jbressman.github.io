<h1 style=color:#d4af37>Last Wednesday I got the opportunity to try Taekwondo for the first time.</h1>

<h3 style="color:#d4af37;">In the past...</h3>
<p style="border:5px solid mediumseagreen;"> While hesitant, I did want to try out as well. While my sister passed, the instructor said that I didn’t have what it takes to be able to do any sort of martial arts at all. While I was a little disappointed that I wouldn’t be able to participate in the class, I was okay with it. By that point, I had already figured out that sports in general didn’t like me very much. While I did like to go outside and play soccer and basketball, I never took the time to fully learn the rules and I can’t seem to run without injuring at least one of my ankles or knees.</p>

<p style="border:5px solid mediumseagreen;"> The week before, my sister told me that the studio was doing a sale where if a new student has a family member that is already a student of the studio, the new student would be able to attend, for the month of January, for free. I had already been wanting to do some self-defense classes and when I told my sister this, she was ecstatic that I would be attending the same class as her.</p>
