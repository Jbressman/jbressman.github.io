<p> After months of the new found 3ds may not credit academia purchases. </p>
<p>This project is creating your own small set of web pages that act as net.art. The project will be divided into a research phase where you construct a sentence or group of phrases to base your net art project. Then you will be tasked to use photo-editing software to create compositions as drafts for the HTML pages. Finally, you'll use these compositions to complete your 5 to 8-page artwork using photo-editing software, HTML, and CSS to make art on the net! The project must be five to eight pages that function as net.art. This means you can't simply post your Photoshop compositions into the browser. Instead, you must use separate image and CSS elements and layer them up using HTML and CSS.</p>
